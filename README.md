## Game Room

* **Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The client requested to extend their Java application into a cloud based application that could be ran on Android or IOS.

* **What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

It is very helpful to know the requirements and problems that need to be resolved. Having these articulated in a design document helps streamline the actual development process of the application.

* **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

In the real world it would be good to have actual costs articualted in either the design document or a separate document.

* **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

UX is an important aspect of development to ensure that the naviagation and use of the application meets the needs of the user. This particular application treats games and their associated components as objects. While generally not considered to be a preferable pattern, this app uses a singleton pattern with the game class to ensure that only one game will be instantiated when run.

* **How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

I used a test-based design approach to ensure small changes in the code would work as expected as opposed to changing many things and trouble shooting across a plethora of potential issues.
